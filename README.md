# vibe-check

**Status: In development!**

vibe-check is a web application built with React + Redux + TypeScript that allows users to discover
new music on Spotify based on acoustic features of music in their library! The backend is simply a
wrapper over Spotify's public API built with Node.js + Express (soon to be a GraphQL wrapper!)
